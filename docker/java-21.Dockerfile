# Dev image: ai-agent-box + a JVM/Python toolchain for agent-assisted builds.
# SDKMAN was considered and rejected: it is per-user (writes to $HOME, which
# the base entrypoint may re-own), depends on a live version catalog (not
# reproducible), and its runtime version-switching has no container use case.
# Instead, toolchains are pinned, checksum-verified tarballs installed
# system-wide — same philosophy as the base image.

# Bump to match the base image tag you built/pulled.

# The base image's runtime user is named after its agent (`opencode` in
# opencode/opencode.Dockerfile, `omp` in omp/omp.Dockerfile), and Docker resolves
# `USER <name>` against the image's /etc/passwd at container start — a name the
# base image does not define yields an image that builds but cannot run. There
# is no safe default: it must match whichever BASE_IMAGE was actually passed,
# so BASE_USER is mandatory (enforced below) and must always be supplied
# alongside BASE_IMAGE, e.g.
#   --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=ai-agent-box-opencode:<x.y.z> --build-arg BASE_USER=opencode
#   --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=ai-agent-box-omp:<x.y.z> --build-arg BASE_USER=omp
# (both variants use uid 10001 and HOME=/home/ai-agent-box, so nothing else in
# this file is base-variant specific).
